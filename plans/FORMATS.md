# FORMATS — Instance File Reference

This is a **system-level** file. It defines the expected structure of every instance-level
file in `plans/`. Reference this when creating or updating instance files.

**Key rule:** When an action generates or updates an instance file, replace all
template/placeholder content with real content. Do not preserve "About this file",
"Purpose", "When to update", or other explanatory preamble from the template stubs.

## VISION.md

**What it is:** The **concept brief** — the durable seed for the Build. The human writes their project idea, intent, constraints, and any early thinking here in whatever form they have (one sentence to several paragraphs). It is the answer to "what are we building and why," captured *before* any planning artifact exists.
**Updated by:** **Human only.** No action ever modifies `VISION.md` — it is read-only to the workflow. `Product.ProductVision` reads it as the seed for `README.md` / `BUILD.md`; `Principal.BuildReview` and `Principal.MilestonePlan` (and any later action) consult it to recover original intent. It is left **untouched, for future reference** — a stable record of the founding concept that does not get pruned or rewritten as the Build evolves.

**VISION.md vs. thread.md:** `VISION.md` is the *durable* seed (original concept, never pruned). `thread.md` is *transient* working memory (questions, answers, review notes) that `PM.ThreadMaintenance` prunes over time. Put the founding idea in `VISION.md`, not `thread.md`.

```
# VISION

<Free-form concept brief: what the project is, why it exists, who it's for,
 key constraints, and any early scope or design thinking. Prose or bullets —
 whatever the human has. May include a size hint (e.g., "size: phase-only"
 or natural-language signals like "small fix" / "full prototype").>
```

There is no required structure — this is human input, read by AI. Keep it as the founding statement of intent; ongoing decisions belong in `DECISIONS.md` / `STANDARDS.md`, and day-to-day working memory belongs in `thread.md`.

---

## BUILD.md

**What it is:** The multi-milestone plan for the current Build — a Build is a major body of work on the product. Describes what is being built, why, scope boundaries, success criteria, and milestone breakdown.
**Updated by:** Created by `Product.ProductVision` (seeded from `VISION.md`); reviewed (not modified) by `Principal.BuildReview`; updated when Build-level scope changes (including resize via `Principal.PlanDiversion`).

```
---
size: full | single-milestone | phase-only | step-only
---
# BUILD — <Build ID>

## Purpose
<What is being built and why — 2-4 sentences>

## Scope
### In scope
- <item>

### Out of scope
- <item>

## Success criteria
- <measurable outcome>

## Milestones
- M1 — <goal>
- M2 — <goal>   <!-- only for size: full -->

## Risks / assumptions
- <item>
```

### Size

The `size` frontmatter field is **required** and selects the planning depth for this build. It is chosen by `Product.ProductVision` (using any hint the human left in `VISION.md`, or inferred from scope) and validated by `Principal.BuildReview` against the milestone breakdown. The four values:

| `size` | Milestones | Phases per M | Steps per P | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `full` | 2+ (typical 3+) | 2+ | 2+ | Full prototype / major feature. Default ceremony. |
| `single-milestone` | exactly 1 | 2+ | 2+ | Substantial feature on an existing product. |
| `phase-only` | exactly 1 | exactly 1 | 2+ | Small feature; one cohesive chunk of work. |
| `step-only` | exactly 1 | exactly 1 | 1–3 | **Not a build** — cursory look, brief human check, implement. Use when the build process would cost more than the work itself (patches, dependency bumps, mechanical edits, well-scoped small fixes). Chosen by intent/risk, not step count. |

`step-only` uses a **carve-out route**: `Product.ProductVision` → `Human.ApproveBuild` (the one mandatory human touchpoint) → `Staff.QuickImplement` → done. It skips `Principal.BuildReview`, `Principal.MilestonePlan`, `Human.ApproveMilestone`, the Q&A loop, standalone `Principal.CodeReview` / `Staff.ReviewReconciliation`, `Writer.DocumentationUpdate`, `Human.PhaseApproval`, `PM.AdvancePhase`, and `PM.MilestoneCloseout`. Verification still happens — `Staff.QuickImplement` self-verifies — only the formal review *actions* are cut.

The other three sizes share the standard action chain (DraftQuestions → … → PhaseApproval). `size` only caps the number of milestones, phases, and steps that downstream actions may plan, independent of all `config.json` knobs. `phase-only` has exactly one phase, so `Writer.DocumentationUpdate` is skipped (`PM.AdvancePhase` short-circuits to `PM.MilestoneCloseout` and there is nothing to document yet at that point — closeout's CHANGELOG entry covers it).

### Prose depth scales with size

Artifacts (`BUILD.md`, `MILESTONE.md`, plans, reviews, documentation updates) **MUST** match prose depth to the declared `size`. An over-detailed artifact for a small size is a defect, not thoroughness — `Principal.BuildReview` flags size↔depth mismatches alongside size↔milestone-count mismatches.

- `step-only` — title + one-line goal + `size` frontmatter. Skip Scope / Success / Risks / Milestones sections unless something is genuinely non-obvious. Reviews and notes are a few bullets, not pages.
- `phase-only` — terse: a short paragraph (or a few bullets) per section. Only the one milestone / one phase that exists.
- `single-milestone` — current depth, but scoped to the one milestone.
- `full` — current depth.

Rule of thumb: the document's length should embarrass you if it doesn't match the size. If a `step-only` `BUILD.md` reads like a `full` one, trim it.

`Principal.PlanDiversion` may resize a build mid-flight; growing past the current size's caps requires the diversion to update `size` and re-route through `Human.ApproveBuild`.

**Missing frontmatter (legacy builds):** If `size` is absent from BUILD.md frontmatter (e.g., a pre-sizing Build that wasn't backfilled), downstream actions MUST treat the build as `size: full`. `Principal.BuildReview` should also flag the missing frontmatter as REQUIRED so the human can backfill an explicit value.

## MILESTONE.md

**What it is:** The multi-phase implementation plan for the current Milestone — a Milestone is one step in the Build's implementation. Contains phases, acceptance criteria, and technical approach.
**Updated by:** Created by `Principal.MilestonePlan`; replaced when switching to a new milestone; updated when phase definitions or acceptance criteria change.

```
# MILESTONE — <Build ID>-<Milestone ID>

## Goal
<One-sentence milestone goal>

## Phases

### P1 — <name>
**What:** <description of the work>
**Acceptance:**
- [ ] <testable criterion>

### P2 — <name>
**What:** <description>
**Acceptance:**
- [ ] <testable criterion>

## Notes / Dependencies
- <item>
```

## STATUS.md

**What it is:** The tactical snapshot of the repo right now — human-readable complement to `state.json` (the routing source of truth).
**Updated by:** Update frequency is configurable via `status_updates` in `config.json` (see below). By default (`pm_only`), only `PM.StatusUpdate` writes to STATUS.md; routing inserts `PM.StatusUpdate` after build/milestone approvals and plan diversions so major transitions are still captured. The one unconditional write is `Product.ProductVision`, which creates the file. Under `never`, STATUS.md is a frozen disabled-stub.

```
# STATUS

**Update configuration:** `status_updates=<value>`

## Now
- Build: <Build ID>
- Milestone: <Milestone ID>
- Phase: <Phase ID or "n/a">

## Blockers
- <brief bullet, or "None">

## Recent
- <what changed in the last action>

## Next
- <high-level next steps — routing detail is in state.json>
```

The `Update configuration` line shows the `status_updates` value at the time of the most recent write. It tells the reader the cadence STATUS is being kept at, which explains any apparent staleness (e.g., a one-phase lag is expected under `pm_only`/`every_milestone`). Every action that writes STATUS must refresh this line from `config.json`.

**Disabled stub** (used when `status_updates=never`):

```
# STATUS

_(STATUS updates disabled via config: status_updates=never)_
```

---

## BACKLOG.md

**What it is:** Prioritized list of pending work, bugs, follow-ups, and tech debt.
**Updated by:** `PM.StatusUpdate`, `PM.MilestoneCloseout`, `Staff.ReviewReconciliation` (when logging tech debt); also when priorities change or new work is discovered.

**Key rule:** BACKLOG tracks **future work items only**. Do not use BACKLOG for in-progress status, remaining tasks in the current phase, or implementation details. Those belong in `state.json` (e.g., `context.notes`) and `thread.md` respectively.

```
# BACKLOG

## P0 (do next)
- <item>

## P1
- <item>

## P2
- <item>
```

---

## CHANGELOG.md

**What it is:** Human-readable record of changes, including brief rationale for notable decisions.
**Updated by:** `PM.StatusUpdate` (per Phase), `PM.MilestoneCloseout` (appends milestone-complete entry under Unreleased). The "Unreleased" → "Released" move belongs to BUILD release, not milestone closeout — milestones are *completed*, not released.

```
# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased
- <item>

## Released
### YYYY-MM-DD
- <item>
```

---

## DECISIONS.md

**What it is:** Standing forward-looking decisions ("going forward, we will always…"). Durable project-specific choices that persist beyond the current milestone.
**Updated by:** `Principal.AnswerQuestions` and `PM.ThreadMaintenance` promote decisions here.

**Recording rule:** Record only if future work would benefit from knowing the rationale. If there is no meaningful rationale to preserve, don't log it.

**Record:** architectural patterns, data model constraints, API design principles, cross-cutting policies, decisions whose reasoning isn't obvious from the code.
**Don't record:** one-off implementation details, local code structure choices, temporary tradeoffs with no long-term relevance, decisions whose rationale is already self-evident in the code or commit message.

### Entry format

Every entry MUST include a `**Why this matters long-term:**` line. If you can't write a meaningful one, the entry doesn't belong here.

```
# DECISIONS

## Standing decisions
- **<short title>.** <decision — "going forward, we will always…"> (YYYY-MM-DD)
  **Why this matters long-term:** <the rationale a future contributor needs to make sense of this — the constraint, tradeoff, or context that justifies the choice>

## Deprecated decisions
- **<short title>.** <decision> (YYYY-MM-DD)
  **Why this matters long-term:** <why it was once true and why it no longer applies>
```

---

## STANDARDS.md

**What it is:** Team-level technical standards portable across projects — testing expectations, architecture rules, code style, quality bar. Keep concise and enforceable.
**Updated by:** `Principal.AnswerQuestions` and `PM.ThreadMaintenance` promote standards here; updated when project expectations change.

**Recording rule:** Record only if future work would benefit from knowing the rationale. If there is no meaningful rationale to preserve, don't log it.

**Record:** testing expectations, lint/style conventions, architecture rules, branching conventions, documentation expectations — rules that should apply across features and across projects.
**Don't record:** local code structure choices, one-off implementation details, project-specific decisions (those go in DECISIONS.md), guidance whose rationale is already self-evident in the code.

### Entry format

Every entry MUST include a `**Why this matters long-term:**` line. If you can't write a meaningful one, the entry doesn't belong here.

```
# STANDARDS

### Testing
- <standard>
  **Why this matters long-term:** <the rationale — quality bar, past incident, portability concern>

### Code style / lint
- <standard>
  **Why this matters long-term:** <rationale>

### Architecture constraints
- <standard>
  **Why this matters long-term:** <rationale>

### Branching convention
- <standard>
  **Why this matters long-term:** <rationale>

### Documentation
- <standard>
  **Why this matters long-term:** <rationale>
```

## thread.md — Append-Only Protocol

**What it is:** Active working memory for the project — a chronological log of questions, answers, review requests, feedback, and decisions. AI-readable, not machine-parseable. (The *founding concept* lives in `VISION.md`, not here — see the VISION.md section above.)
**Updated by:** Most actions append to it; only `PM.ThreadMaintenance` may prune or restructure.

`thread.md` is an **append-only chronological log**. It is not a structured document
with permanent sections. Each action that writes to `thread.md` appends a new entry
**at the bottom**.

### Entry format

```
---
### [Action.ID] — YYYY-MM-DD
<content>
```

### Rules

1. **New entries go at the bottom.** The log is chronological, oldest-first. Never
   prepend at the top or interleave with older entries.
2. **No sub-sections, grouping, or status buckets.** Do not create "Resolved",
   "Open Issues", "Summary", or any other grouping headers. The only headers are the
   per-entry `### [Action.ID] — YYYY-MM-DD` titles. The log is a flat sequence of entries.
3. **Append only.** Never delete, modify, or reorder existing entries.
4. **PM.ThreadMaintenance is the sole exception, and it prunes by deletion.** When
   content is resolved it is **deleted**, not archived in-file. There is no "resolved
   summary" block. Durable content is promoted out of the thread to its permanent home
   (DECISIONS.md, STANDARDS.md, CHANGELOG, or README) before deletion; everything else
   is simply removed. No historical-summary narrative lives here — the CHANGELOG owns
   project history.
5. **Use Q-### IDs for questions** (e.g., Q-001). Reference them by ID when answering.
6. **Review Requests and review feedback are separate entries.** Staff appends the
   request; Principal appends the feedback as the next entry, referencing the request.
7. **Keep entries concise and actionable.** The thread will be pruned periodically,
   but shorter entries delay the need for maintenance.

## config.json

**What it is:** Project-level workflow configuration — tunes process weight (which steps run, how strict reviews are) without changing the state machine or artifact contracts.
**Updated by:** Human only (manually edited). Never modified by any action. Missing file or missing key = default behavior (full process).

```
{
  "$schema": "config.schema.json",
  "code_review": "every_milestone",
  "formal_approval": "every_milestone",
  "documentation_update": "every_milestone",
  "review_strictness": "balanced",
  "re_review_trigger": "auto",
  "status_updates": "pm_only",
  "workspace": {
    "primary_repo": {
      "name": "primary",
      "path": ".",
      "owns_plans": true
    },
    "shared_repos": []
  }
}
```

### Keys

| Key | Options | Default | Effect |
|-----|---------|---------|--------|
| `code_review` | `every_phase` \| `every_milestone` \| `never` | `every_milestone` | When Principal.CodeReview runs after implementation (under `every_milestone`, reviews all phases of the milestone) |
| `formal_approval` | `every_phase` \| `every_milestone` \| `never` | `every_milestone` | When Human.PhaseApproval runs (under `every_milestone`, briefs the whole milestone) |
| `documentation_update` | `every_phase` \| `every_milestone` \| `never` | `every_milestone` | When Writer.DocumentationUpdate runs |
| `review_strictness` | `strict` \| `balanced` \| `pragmatic` | `balanced` | Threshold for REQUIRED vs. SUGGESTED in code review |
| `re_review_trigger` | `required` \| `auto` | `auto` | Whether code changes in reconciliation always trigger re-review |
| `status_updates` | `every_action` \| `pm_only` \| `every_milestone` \| `never` | `pm_only` | How often STATUS.md is written. `pm_only` and below write only via `PM.StatusUpdate` (routing fans approvals/diversions through it so major transitions are still captured) |
| `workspace` | object | single-repo placeholder | Multi-root workspace definition (primary repo + shared repos) |

For `every_milestone` options: the step runs only on the last phase of each milestone.
Templates consult this file when making routing decisions. See `config.schema.json` for full descriptions.

### `workspace` block

Defines the repos that participate in the workspace and how SAM routes artifact writes
across them. The block has two parts:

- `primary_repo` (required) — the repo that owns `plans/`. Exactly one per workspace.
  - `name` — human-readable name
  - `path` — absolute or workspace-relative path to the repo root
  - `owns_plans` — must be `true`
- `shared_repos` (optional, default `[]`) — repos that may receive code edits and
  `STANDARDS.md` / `DECISIONS.md` updates without their own `plans/` wrapper.
  - `name` / `path` / `role` — name, root path, and a brief description of the repo's role

**Explicit-identification rule:** SAM never infers the primary repo from cwd or `"."`.
If you use multi-root, set real workspace-relative paths for both `primary_repo.path`
and every `shared_repos[].path`. Single-repo projects can leave the placeholder defaults
(the `shared_repos` array is empty, so nothing matches shared scope and all writes go
to `primary_repo/plans/`).

### Scope-of-change routing

When an action edits files or records knowledge, classify the scope of each write and
route it accordingly. There are two scopes:

- **Project scope** — writes go to `primary_repo/plans/`. This is the default.
- **Shared scope** — writes go to a `shared_repos[]` location, with a *narrow* surface:
  - Code under `shared_repos[].path`
  - `shared_repos[].path/STANDARDS.md`
  - `shared_repos[].path/DECISIONS.md`
  - **No `plans/` wrapper** — shared repos never receive a `plans/` directory.

**Detection rule:** scope is determined by **path match**. If an edit's path is inside
any `shared_repos[].path`, that edit is shared scope. Everything else is project scope.
The `.code-workspace` file may inform context but is **not authoritative**.

**Project-scoped decisions about shared code stay in `primary_repo/plans/DECISIONS.md`.**
A decision affects shared scope only when its rationale is platform-wide (would apply to
any project using that shared code). Promotion from project DECISIONS/STANDARDS to a
shared repo's DECISIONS/STANDARDS is handled by `PM.ThreadMaintenance` with explicit
human approval — see `PM_ThreadMaintenance.txt` for the proposal/approval protocol.

---

## state.json

**What it is:** Routing source of truth — tracks the current position in the BUILD → MILESTONE → PHASE → STEP hierarchy and determines which action runs next. Validated by `state.schema.json`.
**Updated by:** Every action (mandatory). Must always reflect what just happened and what should happen next.

### `last_action.result` values

The `result` field MUST be one of these schema-valid enum values. Do NOT use "complete", "done", "success", or any other string.

| Value | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `ok` | Action completed successfully. Default for most actions (ProductVision, MilestonePlan, DraftQuestions, AnswerQuestions, ImplementationExecution, ReviewReconciliation, StatusUpdate, DocumentationUpdate, AdvancePhase, MilestoneCloseout, ThreadMaintenance, ResolveBlocker). |
| `approved` | A review or approval action approved the artifact (BuildReview, CodeReview, PhaseApproval, ApproveMilestone). |
| `changes_required` | A review found issues that must be addressed before proceeding (BuildReview, CodeReview). |
| `blocked` | Action cannot proceed; a blocker has been added to `blockers[]`. |
| `error` | Unexpected failure occurred; `Human.ResolveBlocker` is next. |
| `skipped` | Action was intentionally skipped (e.g., DraftQuestions self-skip when path is clear, DocumentationUpdate when no doc changes needed). |

### `last_action.summary` guidance

`summary` is a plain, factual description of **what was done** — not a defense of *how* it
was handled. State the action and its concrete result; keep the useful specifics (what
changed, current position, what runs next). Aim short and factual: most summaries need
one or two sentences. Don't over-correct into cryptic terseness — a summary should still
read as a sentence.

**Omit** meta-justification that is already derivable from `config.json` + `state.json`:
- Config-value citations used to explain a *non-action* — e.g. `(status_updates=pm_only)`
  to justify not touching STATUS.md, or `(code_review=every_milestone)` to justify skipping review.
- "No X changes because…" explanations for things that simply didn't happen.
- `pause_type` reasoning (the `pause_type` field already carries it).

```
✅ "Implemented search pagination; 3 files changed. Next: Principal.CodeReview."
❌ "Implemented search pagination. Did not update STATUS.md because status_updates=pm_only,
    and set pause_type=continue since the next actor is not Human.*. No config changes."
```
